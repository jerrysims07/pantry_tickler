==============

A home pantry inventory tickler system to alert you when it is time to replenish items around the home

This app will help keep you stocked up on items around the home.  With a little thought beforehand about how quickly you go through items, this database will suggest to you when it is time to pick up that extra item that may have fallen through the cracks.

Features:
* User can add new staple items to the database 
* User can edit the rate of consumption of each item in the database to better fit the habits of her household.
* User can print a proposed Shopping List at any time of those items that are nearing empty.

This app will track the rate of consumption for household and attempt to "learn" the expected time to empty based on what is currently in inventory around the house.

There will be no external data used in this app.
